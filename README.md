# How to use:<br>Click on the >Live application< above.<br>Once the app is open, read and follow the tooltip for instructions on how to play.

# Built with:<br>Jest (TDD)<br>javascript<br>webpack<br>node<br>html<br>css

# High Priority on:<br>Simple and sleek design<br>Looks clean, very simple and easy to understand and use UI.

# Highlight features:<br>This app features Jest, and using test driven development.<br>Making tests first, before writing out the code was a very educational, satisfying and rewarding experience. It was very easy to ensure my logic was doing what I expected it to.<br>I genuinely enjoyed TDD, and hope to keep using it moving forward.

# Future additions:<br>More tooltips! - probably one of the more fun parts of creating the app.<br>Cleaning up the files (structure could be improved for easier navigation.)
